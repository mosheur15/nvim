## my simple neovim
just clone it inside $HOME/.config folder.
open neovim anywhere and it'll install everything.

## Note:
lsp needs to be manually installed with mason for auto completion source.
open mason from neovim and install what you need. activate them from lsp.lua file.
some are already there. so make sure to check em out and install.
